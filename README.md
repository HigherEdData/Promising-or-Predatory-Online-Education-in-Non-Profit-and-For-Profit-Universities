# Assessing Online Education with IPEDS

### By Christian Smith

Summary: We use IPEDS to assess the equity implications of the expansion of exclusively online higher education degree programs. 

**Data**
  - IPEDS Online Enrollment
  - IPEDS Fall Enrollment by Race
  - IPEDS Financial Aid and Net Price
  - IPEDS Graduation

A preanalysis plan is available here: https://osf.io/524va

The repository thus far includes code that automates the downloading and building of datasets from public IPEDS source data. We also include code that plots the expansion of exclusively online degree programs. All replication code is in STATA but is provided and executed in Jupyter Notebooks (.ipnynb) using a Stata Kernel. For details see: https://kylebarron.dev/stata_kernel/

If you would like to use the STATA code, you can browse .ipynb NoteBook files in this repository and cut and paste code into your own STATA .do files.

If you would like to edit and execute the .ipynb NoteBook files but do not have Jupyter, you can use the following instructions prepared by Derek Devnich for installing Git, Jupyter, and the STATA Kernel for Jupyter:
* Install Git: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/git/install
* Install the Anaconda distribution of Python. This will also install Jupyter Lab: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/install
* Configure Jupyter Lab to use the STATA kernel: https://libguides.ucmerced.edu/software-carpentry/python/stata
